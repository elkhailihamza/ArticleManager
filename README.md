## Everything I learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

- Welcome to this README.md, where you learn what I learned throughout this brief, in (OOP)!

1. **Classes and Objects**

- Classes are like structures, defining the properties and actions of objects, the only diffrence is that they can have functions, or modules as they are called. Objects are instances of those classes and imitate real world items plus embody their characteristics. Example: Imagine a class called vehicle, with the properties, color, type and price. We can create an object or instance called "Lamborghini Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce Roadster", with the color 'Red', the type 'sportscar' and the price '$463,416'.

2. **Encapsulation**

- Encapsulation, is the act of keeping data in a safe and secure box, with private properties. How you can fetch these properties is with the use of setter and getter methods.

3. **Inheritance**

- Inheritance allows you to fetch the properties of a parent class, from a child class.

4. **Polymorphism**

- Polymorphism, is like having a universal remote, usable in every situation. It consists of "OVERLOADING" and "OVERRIDING", they are the act of putting more or less parameters in an inherited function than the original function and changing what the inherited function holds respectively. Example: Let's say we have a class "parent" with the method "details" that is empty, and a class "child" that inherits the method "details" from the "parent" class. If we add parameters to the "details" method in the "child" class, it's called "OVERLOADING", and if we add or change it's content, it is called "OVERRIDING". Bear in mind that I'am bad at explaining.

5. **Setter and Getter Methods**

- Setter and Getter methods allow you to set data in private or protected properties, and fetch it. respectively.
